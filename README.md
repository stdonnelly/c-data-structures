# C Data Structures

This repository is my implementation of some common data structures in C, and some data structure operations, such as sorting.
Most of these are influenced by either the C++ standard template library, or the Java standard library.
To allow me to more easily use these structures, most of these will have a generic header file and some executable testing code.
